The International Oral History Association (IOHA) is a professional association of oral history practitioners and exists to:
# Provide a forum for oral historians around the world, and a means for cooperation among those concerned with the documentation of human experience
# Stimulate and publish the results of research in the techniques of oral history
# Promote the development of standards and principles for individuals, institutions and agencies (both public and private) with responsibilities for the collection and preservation of historical information gathered through the techniques of oral history, in all forms
# Encourage and organise international conferences and meetings
# Foster a better understanding of the nature and value of oral history
# Participate in international projects, or devise such projects, and to work with those organising such projects
# Support and develop national oral history organisations
The IOHA was formally constituted in June 1996 at the IXth International Oral History Conference in Gothenburg, Sweden.
